## Mission Statement
Education can change a life. This sentiment cannot be denied but education can be. Schools deem a students "unteachable" or create a hostile environments in which the student may not *want* to attend school. There may be problems at home that cause the student to become distracted or they may be unable to afford textbooks and other learning resources.
		Although there are many mobile applications that claim to educate but they leave a lot to the learner. This does not seem unreasonable until you realize that the people who would benefit the most from education, for one reason or another, must be incentivized to learn.
		We are attempting to build an application that will give people no choice but to learn, and if we cannot teach them, hopefully we can diagnose them.
		We are targeting all students who have had a strained relationship with the education system. From children who have been kicked out of school to people who find themselves in trouble with the law. 
		We will use any and every resource we can to give people the full benefit of deep learning, big data, open source textbooks, and the large computing power freely available today. 
# What the App will do
The app will look like any other mobile learning app on the front end. The power of the app comes from the analytics we will be doing on the back end. We will me putting in anti-cheating measures, collecting data about learning duration, constancy, and efficiency. We will collect this data to pinpoint students who are having trouble learning and zone in on why that may be (environment or an undiagnosed learning disability). s
## Who we need
We need people who are willing to work and willing to learn. We need self starters who understand the importance of team work. The candidate should be able to read documentation and report the pros and cons of different packages and technologies.
Below is a list of areas in which we will need help. They will all be implemented using Python. If you have experience in any of these fields or an interest in them, let us know.	

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web developers
- Deep learning 
- Data Engineering
- Web Designers
- [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/) 
- noSQL ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/))
- Technical writers
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Artificial Intelligence Lead

## Our Stack
We are using [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/) on the server and [Stanford NLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/corenlp/process) to process the textbooks we import. Since we are just starting out. Our team communicates using [Slack](https://slack.com/) and will push most of our work to Github. 
## What to Expect
Once you have decided to come on board 

1. you will get an email from Slack giving you access
2. You will be added to the Github repo (once you have 	an account)
3. We will agree on a specific task for you to work on
